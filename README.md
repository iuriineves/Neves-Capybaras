## Features
### Capybaras:
- Capybaras are new mobs found in swamps, mangrove swamps and river biomes. They will spawn anywhere on those, usually in groups of 3-4 capybaras, but will spawn way more frequently at Capybara's Paradise, also found in mangrove swamps.
- Capybaras will follow you if you hold a melon slice. It also allows you to breed them.
- Capybaras are semiaquatic animals, so they spawn more often near water bodies. However, they do not need water in order to survive.
- Capybaras are really fast swimmers. If you grab a melon slice in front of them while swimming, they'll catch up to you in a heartbeat.
### Capybaras' Paradise:
- A new structure found in mangrove swamps. Here, capybaras spawn more often than in the rest of the swamp, as well as staying closer to these structures.
- You'll find lots of watermelons scattered around, as well as small ponds with thermal springs, currently being the only way to obtain this new block.
### Mandarins:
- Mandarin bush:
  - Despite being totally not realistic, mandarin bushes are the way to get the new fruit.
  - You can find mandarins, mandarin leaves and flowering mandarin leaves in these bushes.
  - These bushes only spawn on the plains biome, so make sure to gather some saplings to plant them anywhere else you might want to have it.
- Mandarin:
  - A new food type. Eating this will give you 2 hunger points + the "Sweetened" status effect for 5 seconds.
  - You can put a mandarin on a capybara's head by right-clicking them while holding a mandarin. To remove it, just right-click the capybara while sneaking, and the mandarin will drop right off.
- Mandarin leaves:
  - A new decorative block that when broken, has a chance at dropping either mandarins, a mandarin bush sapling, or sticks.
  - This block has a second variant, the flowering mandarin leaves, only being visually different.

### Thermal springs:
- A new decorative block. This block emits steam particles from the water blocks above it in a 5 block radius. 
- If there's water below it, the thermal spring essentially becomes a geyser, shooting steam particles up.
- The only way to find this block is to find a Capybaras' Paradise structure, where the ponds will have this block at the bottom of them.
- The particles are a bit performance intensive, so use these sparingly (spacing them 10 block apart should give you the most use out of them).
### Sweetened:
- A new effect. While having this effect, all food gives you 50% more hunger points (1.5x). For golden apples and enchanted golden apples, as well as the 50% more hunger points, you'll also get 2 more absorption hearts (4 health points).
- This effect is only obtainable through eating mandarins, and it only has a single level.

## FAQ

**Can I include this mod in a modpack?**

**Yes**: You can, no need for approval. However, I would love to know what modpacks are using this mod, so don't hesitate to message me on discord! (iuriineves).

**I found a bug! What do I do?**

**Open an issue**: Just make an issue on this mod's github page and I'll try to fix is as soon as I can. Make sure to explain how to reproduce the bug as well.

**No**: I only mod for the Fabric loader, so other modloader versions are not going to happen. Sorry! (A quilt version might happen, though)
